MRSEILA: a modified remote sensing ecological index using local adaptability for enhancing ecological quality assessment

Assessing ecological environment quality (EEQ) using satellite observations is critical for promoting sustainable regional development. The Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) has been widely applied in EEQ assessments by integrating multiple environmental factors. RSEI with local adaptability (RSEILA) was designed to improve the capability of RSEI in capturing local ecological variations using moving windows. However, the randomness in eigenvector directions generated by principal component analysis (PCA) can introduce biases into RSEILAâ€™s assessment accuracy. To enhance the effectiveness of RSEILA in EEQ, we propose a modified RSEILA model (MRSEILA) implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. MRSEILA consists of three components: (1) optimization of moving window sizes tailored to each target region; (2) automatic recognition and correction of PCA-induced eigenvector direction inconsistency; and (3) refinement of PCA computation within each window to derive accurate EEQ evaluations. We validated the MRSEILA using Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 surface reflectance data and compared its performance with RSEILA across four typical areas in China. The results showed that: (1) optimized moving window sizes differed across four regions; (2) MRSEILA produced consistent combinations of eigenvector direction; (3) EEQ assessments outputs derived from MRSEILA aligned closely with actual land surface landscapes. (4) Compared to RSEILA, MRSEILA demonstrated superior performance in optimizing moving windows, resolving eigenvector direction inconsistencies, and delivering accurate EEQ assessments, which represents an effective tool for supporting regional and large-scale ecological monitoring.

This script implements the MRSEILA model (Modified Remote Sensing-based Ecological Index with Local Adaptability) in Google Earth Engine. It performs localized PCA within moving windows centered on sample points to derive the first principal component (PC1) from four normalized remote sensing indicators (NDVI, WET, NDBSI, LST). The PCA direction is corrected to ensure consistency. The study area is divided into grid cells, and for each cell, the resulting PC1 image is exported, enabling spatially adaptive ecological assessment.
