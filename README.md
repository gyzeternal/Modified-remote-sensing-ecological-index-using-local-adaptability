MRSEILA: a modified remote sensing ecological index using local adaptability for enhancing ecological quality assessment

The Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) has been widely applied in ecological environment quality (EEQ) assessments by integrating multiple environmental factors. To enhance RSEI’s ability to capture local ecological variations, a locally adapted version (RSEILA) was designed and widely adopted using moving windows. However, the randomness in eigenvector directions generated by principal component analysis (PCA) can introduce bias, affecting the accuracy of RSEILA’s assessment. To enhance the effectiveness of RSEILA in EEQ, we propose a modified RSEILA model (MRSEILA) implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, consisting of three components: (1) optimization of moving window sizes tailored to each target region; (2) automatic recognition and correction of PCA-induced eigenvector direction inconsistencies; and (3) refinement of PCA computation within each circular window to improve the accuracy of EEQ evaluations. We validated MRSEILA using Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 surface reflectance data and compared its performance with RSEILA across four typical areas in China. The results showed that, compared to RSEILA, MRSEILA consistently produces aligned eigenvector directions and more accurate EEQ assessments that better reflect actual land surface conditions across all four testing areas, making it an effective tool for regional and large-scale ecological monitoring.

This script implements the MRSEILA model (Modified Remote Sensing-based Ecological Index with Local Adaptability) in Google Earth Engine. It performs improved PCA within moving windows centered on sample points to derive the first principal component (PC1) from four normalized remote sensing indicators (NDVI, WET, NDBSI, LST). The PC1 eigenvector direction is corrected to ensure consistency. The study area is divided into grid cells, and for each cell, the resulting PC1 image is exported, enabling spatially adaptive ecological assessment.
